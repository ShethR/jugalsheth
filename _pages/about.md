Welcome to my website! My name is Jugal Sheth, and I'm a machine learning enthusiast with a passion for Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).

As a Principal Machine Learning Engineer at Consumer Edge Insight, I've designed, developed, and deployed various ML systems, including classification, entity matching, and recommendation engines.

Prior to my current role, I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at Markable Inc, where I built advanced systems for object detection, semantic segmentation, and image retrieval.

I hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington, where I focused on Neural Networks under the guidance of Dr. Michal T. Manry.

When I'm not working on machine learning projects, I regularly practice meditation (specifically, Vipassana - an ancient Buddhist mindfulness meditation practice), which helps me to clear my mind and gain an objective perspective on the world.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find my website informative and engaging!
